# Ideas for future work on the pixlAnalyzer

radio chip: nrf52832, no PMIC.

The radio covers 2.4GHz ISM band, which is commonly used for various wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Zigbee.

Right now it only measures RSSI for spectrum analysis, on the range of 2400-2487MHz, with 1MHz steps.
(128 pixel display, so on average 1,45 pixels per frequency, some frequencies will have 2 pixels, some 1 pixel)

This functionality can be expanded in several ways:

1. **Signal identification**: Implement decoding for common protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee, Thread,..), or Wi-Fi. This would allow the device to not only detect signals but also identify the data being transmitted.

Some shortcomings that can be improved (and have not been done yet):

1. better voltage calibration. On my OLED based device: 2.4V becomes 2.5V on screen, and 4V becomes 4.15V on screen.

And why not move to the latest SDK version while at it?
