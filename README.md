# ATC1441 pixlAnalyzer

Simple 2.4GHz Spectrum Analyzer based on the nRF52832 in the PixlJs allmiibo emulator

This Firmware is currently compatible with the LCD and OLED variant you can get on Aliexpress for around 10-15€ it will make it a very simple battery powered 2400 - 2487MHz Spectrum Analyzer with a Waterfall like history show with little options.

## Version history

2025-12-06: first release

2026-01-xx (WIP):

* Button debouncing
* LCD contrast adjustment made possible via menu
* Long press (5 seconds) to enter sleep mode
* Channel visualisation: Use the scroll wheel to select waterfall view or channel identification view, to give a better idea what the signals represent. It can show three different channel types: the IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee,..), 802.11b/g/n WiFi and BLE channels. See [Frequency range and channels](#frequency-range-and-channels) below. The chip is unfortunately incapable of filtering the different protocols, so its just a visual aid for now. Working on that...

## Flashing

You can flash this firmware fully OTA and go back to the stock Pixl.js firmware as well.
Navigate to the Pixl.js firmware settings and enter the "Firmware Update" menu
The device will reboot and show "DFU Update" now use the nRFConnect App to connect to the "Pixl DFU" device showing.
Select the correct firmware update file "PixlAnalyzerLCD.zip" or "PixlAnalyzerOLED.zip" depending on your device and it will flash and reboot to the new Firmware.

To Go back to the Pixl.js firmware you can open the menu by pressing the middle button, then navigate to "Firmware Update" and flash the Stock firmware in the same way again.

## Compiling

Its made to be used with Windows right now some changes will be needed to make it Linux compatible.
You need to have installed:

* `make`
* `gcc-arm-none-eabi`
  * set the path to the gcc's bin folder in the `/pixlAnalyzer/firmware/sdk/components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.posix` or ...`Makefile.windows` file, depending on your OS.
  * example for MacOS: `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT ?= /Applications/ArmGNUToolchain/14.2.rel1/arm-none-eabi/bin/`
* `nrfutil`
  * unless you have a very old version (that is, 6.x or lower), you will also need to run `nrfutil install nrf5sdk-tools` after installation of nrfutil.

## Frequency range and channels

The 2.4GHz ISM band is divided into several channels used by different protocols. Here are some common channel allocations:

| Center Frequency<br>(MHz) | IEEE 802.15.4<br>channel, 5MHz wide | 802.11b/g/n WiFi<br>channel, 22/20/40MHz wide | BLE<br>channel, 2MHz wide |

In the screens below you can see it's use. It can help identifying BLE and 802.15.4 (eg: Zigbee) traffic.
The lines represent the center frequencies, and the dotted lines the BLE advertising channels.
